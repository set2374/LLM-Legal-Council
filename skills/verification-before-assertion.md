# Verification Before Assertion

## Purpose

Prevent confident wrong assertions by requiring verification before stating legal principles or factual claims.  This skill addresses the most critical failure pattern in legal analysis: high-confidence assertions on unverified information.

## When This Applies

This skill activates when about to:

- State what a statute "requires," "mandates," "provides," or "prohibits"
- Cite legal doctrine, rules, or standards
- Assert facts about dates, amounts, parties, roles, or events
- Express confidence levels (especially high confidence)
- Characterize holdings or quote from cases

## Verification Protocol

### For Legal Principles

**Step 1: Identify jurisdiction**
- Federal or state?
- If state: which state?  Which department or circuit?
- Are there jurisdiction-specific variations?

**Step 2: Locate authority**
- Quote actual statutory text, OR
- Cite specific case with holding
- If relying on general knowledge without verification: FLAG explicitly

**Step 3: Verify currency**
- Has statute been amended?
- Has case been overruled or distinguished?
- Is the rule still current?

**Step 4: Check for jurisdiction-specific rules**

Common traps:
- Model rules ≠ state-specific professional conduct rules
- Federal rules ≠ state procedural rules
- UCC varies by state adoption
- Local court rules modify general rules

### For Factual Assertions

**Step 1: Identify source**
- Which document contains this fact?
- What page, paragraph, or exhibit?

**Step 2: Verify against source**
- Quote or cite specific location
- If source not reviewed: FLAG as unverified

**Step 3: Apply source reliability hierarchy**

| Tier | Source Type | Treatment |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 | Executed documents, court filings, official records | Cite directly |
| 2 | Attorney correspondence, formal analyses | Verify before relying |
| 3 | Client statements, call notes, informal characterizations | Treat as theory requiring verification |

**Rule:** Never build legal argument on Tier 3 source without Tier 1 or Tier 2 corroboration.

## Confidence Calibration

### Before Stating Any Confidence Level

**High confidence requires:**
- Statutory text quoted directly, OR
- Case law verified against actual source, OR
- Facts confirmed against documentary record (Tier 1)

**Medium confidence appropriate when:**
- Legal principle from established doctrine with jurisdiction verified
- Facts from Tier 2 sources
- Reasonable inference from verified facts

**Low confidence required when:**
- General knowledge only, no verification
- Facts from Tier 3 sources only
- Novel legal question without clear authority
- Uncertainty about jurisdiction-specific rules

### Calibration Rules

1. Never state high confidence on legal conclusion without direct verification
2. Never assert statutory requirements without confirming actual text
3. Never treat unverified statements as established facts
4. Always flag when relying on general knowledge vs. verified authority

## Placeholder Syntax

When unable to verify, use explicit markers:

```
[VERIFY] — Assertion needs confirmation before relying on it
[VERIFY: specific item] — Specific element needs confirmation
[CITATION NEEDED] — Legal proposition lacks supporting authority
[CITATION NEEDED: proposition] — Specific proposition needs authority
[RECORD CITE NEEDED] — Factual assertion needs documentary support
[RECORD CITE NEEDED: description] — Specific fact needs source
```

## Red Flags

Stop and verify before proceeding if you notice:

- About to state percentage confidence on legal issue
- Using words like "clearly," "obviously," "certainly" about legal conclusions
- Building argument on something from informal conversation or notes
- Adopting a characterization from one side's pleadings without checking
- Asserting jurisdiction-specific rule without confirming that jurisdiction's law
- Quoting a case without having read the relevant portion

## The Core Discipline

**The goal is accuracy, not speed.**

When uncertain, verify.  When unable to verify, flag.  Never assert with confidence what has not been confirmed.

Placeholders are not failures—they are professional practice.  A flagged uncertainty is infinitely more valuable than a confident error.
