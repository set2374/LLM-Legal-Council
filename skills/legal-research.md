# Legal Research

## Purpose

Methodology for finding and evaluating legal authority.  This skill teaches HOW to research—where to look, how to evaluate what you find, and how to build a sound authority chain.

## Core Principle

**Never cite authority without verification.**  Unverified citations destroy credibility.  Prioritize accuracy over comprehensiveness.

## Research Sources

### Primary Free Sources

**CourtListener.com** — Primary source for case law
- Comprehensive federal and state case database
- Includes "Cited By" for subsequent treatment
- Search by jurisdiction, date range, keywords

**Cornell LII** — Primary source for statutes and regulations
- U.S. Code, Code of Federal Regulations
- State statutes (coverage varies)
- Federal Rules (Civil Procedure, Evidence, Appellate)
- Uniform laws

**Official Court Websites** — Primary source for rules and forms
- Local rules (district-specific)
- Standing orders
- Individual judge practices
- Current forms

**Findlaw** — Secondary source for case law and encyclopedic content
- Good for initial orientation
- Verify citations against primary sources

**Google Scholar** — Backup case law source
- Useful for hard-to-find cases
- Less comprehensive than CourtListener

### Authority Hierarchy

When sources conflict, higher authority controls:

1. **Constitutional provisions** — Supreme law
2. **Statutes and regulations** — As enacted (not as glossed by cases)
3. **Court rules** — Including local rules and standing orders
4. **Binding precedent** — Controlling court for the forum
5. **Persuasive precedent** — Other jurisdictions, lower courts, dissents
6. **Secondary sources** — Treatises, restatements, law reviews, practice guides

**Key distinction:** A case interpreting a statute does not change the statute.  If statutory text conflicts with a case's interpretation, note the tension.

## Research Protocol

### Step 1: Frame the Research Question

Before searching, define:

- **Jurisdiction**: Federal or state?  Which circuit/department/district?
- **Legal issue**: Specific elements, standards, defenses
- **Factual context**: What facts trigger what rules?
- **Purpose**: What do you need to establish or refute?

### Step 2: Identify Controlling Authority

**For statutory questions:**
- Locate the statute (Cornell LII, official state sites)
- Read the actual text (not summaries)
- Check effective date and amendments
- Find implementing regulations if any

**For common law questions:**
- Identify the controlling court for your forum
- Search for on-point decisions from that court
- If none, look to the next level up, then persuasive authority

**For procedural questions:**
- Start with the applicable rules (FRCP, state rules)
- Check local rules for the specific court
- Check individual judge's practices if available

### Step 3: Evaluate Each Authority

For every case or source you consider citing:

**Is it binding or persuasive?**
- Same jurisdiction and court level = binding
- Different jurisdiction or lower court = persuasive only
- State clearly which you have

**Is it still good law?**
- Check "Cited By" or subsequent history
- Has it been overruled, limited, or distinguished?
- Are there more recent cases on point?

**Is it actually on point?**
- Read the full opinion, not just the snippet
- What was the procedural posture?
- What were the material facts?
- Is the quoted language holding or dicta?

**How factually similar is it?**
- What facts made the difference in that case?
- Are your facts analogous or distinguishable?

### Step 4: Build the Authority Chain

A complete authority chain includes:

- **Controlling authority**: What directly governs this issue in this jurisdiction
- **Supporting authority**: Additional cases reinforcing the rule
- **Contrary authority**: Cases that cut the other way (you must know these)
- **Distinguishing analysis**: Why contrary authority doesn't control

### Step 5: Check for Contrary Authority

**This step is mandatory.**  Before concluding research:

- Search for cases reaching opposite conclusions
- Search for cases distinguishing your best authority
- Search for statutory amendments or rule changes
- Search for pending legislation or proposed rule changes

If you find contrary authority, you must address it.  If you cannot find contrary authority, state that you searched and found none—but remain open to its existence.

## Evaluating Authority Quality

### Strong Authority

- On point (same legal issue, similar facts)
- From controlling jurisdiction
- Recent (within last 10-15 years unless seminal)
- Majority opinion (not concurrence or dissent)
- Well-reasoned with clear holding
- Followed by subsequent courts

### Weak Authority

- Analogous but distinguishable
- From persuasive jurisdiction only
- Old (especially if area of law has evolved)
- Concurrence, dissent, or dicta
- Conclusory without reasoning
- Limited, criticized, or questioned by subsequent courts

### Red Flags

- Case you cannot locate in any database
- Citation format that doesn't match standard reporters
- Quote that doesn't appear in the cited source
- Holding broader than the case actually supports
- "Majority rule" claims without citation to actual jurisdictions

## Verification Discipline

**Before citing any authority:**

1. Have you located the actual source?
2. Have you read the relevant portions (not just snippets)?
3. Have you verified the citation format?
4. Have you checked subsequent treatment?
5. Is the quote verbatim (if quoting)?
6. Is the holding accurately characterized?

**If you cannot verify, do not cite.**  Use placeholders:
- `[VERIFY: citation]` — Citation needs confirmation
- `[VERIFY: holding]` — Characterization needs confirmation
- `[CITATION NEEDED]` — Proposition needs supporting authority

## Common Research Errors

- Citing cases without reading them
- Treating dicta as holding
- Ignoring procedural posture
- Missing contrary authority
- Over-relying on secondary sources
- Assuming federal rule matches state rule
- Failing to check local rules
- Citing overruled or limited cases
