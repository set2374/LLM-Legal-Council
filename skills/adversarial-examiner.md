# Adversarial Examiner

## Purpose

Force rigorous self-examination before delivering legal analysis.  This skill combats the tendency toward shallow pattern-matching by requiring adversarial testing of your own conclusions.

## Core Principle

Before presenting any legal conclusion, you must be able to articulate the strongest argument against it.  If you cannot, your analysis is incomplete.

## Assumption Extraction

Every legal analysis rests on assumptions.  Make them explicit.

For each material assumption underlying your analysis, identify:

- **What you are assuming** (fact, procedural posture, legal rule, party relationship)
- **The basis for the assumption** (record citation, user statement, inference, or unstated)
- **What changes if the assumption is wrong** (does conclusion hold?  does analysis change?)

If you cannot identify your assumptions, you are pattern-matching, not analyzing.

Common hidden assumptions:
- Procedural posture (what stage is this case at?)
- Jurisdiction (which court's law applies?)
- Undisputed facts (are these actually undisputed?)
- Party relationships (who owes duties to whom?)
- Document authenticity (are the documents what they purport to be?)

## Threshold Analysis

Before substantive analysis, assess whether the case can proceed at all.

**Threshold issues to evaluate:**

| Issue | Key Questions |
|-------|---------------|
| Jurisdiction | Does this court have subject matter jurisdiction?  Personal jurisdiction?  Is venue proper? |
| Standing | Does this party have injury?  Causation?  Redressability?  Statutory standing if required? |
| Timeliness | What is the limitations period?  When did the claim accrue?  Is there tolling? |
| Prerequisites | Was required notice given?  Demand made?  Administrative remedies exhausted? |
| Preclusion | Is there a prior judgment?  Same claim or issue?  Same parties or privity? |

**For each threshold issue, assess:**
- Known (confirmed by record or authority)
- Assumed (inferred from context, not confirmed)
- Unknown (cannot determine from available information)

**Rule:** If any threshold issue is Unknown and potentially dispositive, surface it as a blocker before proceeding to substantive analysis.  An Unknown threshold can render the entire substantive analysis moot.

## Opposing Counsel Simulation

This is the heart of adversarial examination.

**Before finalizing your analysis, draft opposing counsel's best argument.**

Requirements:
1. The argument must be **case-dispositive** (wins the motion or case), not merely "a counterpoint"
2. Identify the **specific evidence** opposing counsel would cite
3. Identify the **authority** they would invoke
4. Explain **why this argument is dangerous**—what makes it potentially winning

**Test:** If your opposing argument is easily refuted in a sentence, you have not found their best shot.  Real adversaries find real weaknesses.

**Common failure mode:** Constructing a weak strawman opposing argument that makes your conclusion look stronger than it is.  This is self-deception, not analysis.

## Element and Factor Audit

For every claim or defense in your analysis:

**Identify all required elements or factors:**
- What must be proved to establish this claim or defense?
- Which party bears the burden on each element?

**Map facts to elements:**
- What evidence supports each element?
- Is that evidence in the record or assumed?

**Identify gaps:**
- Which elements lack factual support?
- Are these gaps fillable (through discovery, investigation) or fatal?

**Rule:** Do not conclude a claim succeeds without evidence on every element.  Do not conclude a defense fails without testing every element.

## Dissonance Detection

**If record is substantial:** Look for contradictions, tensions, or inconsistencies in the available materials.  What facts don't fit the narrative?  What documents contradict each other?  What would opposing counsel emphasize?

**If record is thin:** Generate hypotheses about what could be different from what's presented.  What facts, if true, would change the outcome?  What should be investigated?

"No dissonance found" is almost never accurate in contested matters.  If you find none, look harder or generate hypotheses.

## Confidence Assessment

Assess your analysis across three dimensions:

**Factual completeness:**
- High: All material facts established by record citations
- Medium: Most facts established; some gaps identified
- Low: Significant reliance on assumptions or unverified statements

**Legal conclusion soundness:**
- High: On-point binding authority cited for each legal conclusion
- Medium: Analogical or persuasive authority; reasonable extrapolation
- Low: General principles only; no case-specific authority

**Procedural accuracy:**
- High: Procedural posture, applicable standards, and deadlines confirmed
- Medium: Posture assumed from context; not independently verified
- Low: Procedural posture unclear; may affect applicable standards

**Escalation:** If any dimension is Low, flag the specific issue and what information is needed to resolve it.

## Audit Stamp

Every substantive legal analysis should conclude with a brief verification block:

> **Audit**: Posture: [stated or assumed posture].  Threshold issues: [any Unknown or potential blockers, or "None identified"].  Opposing argument: [one sentence summary of best attack].  Key gaps: [top 1-3 factual or legal gaps].  Confidence: Facts [H/M/L], Law [H/M/L], Procedure [H/M/L].

**Purpose:** The audit stamp makes examination verifiable.  Generic filler that doesn't match the analysis indicates failed examination.  Peer reviewers can assess whether the audit stamp reflects genuine engagement.

## Signs of Failed Examination

Watch for these patterns in your own work:

- Audit stamp contains generic language not specific to the matter
- Opposing argument is weak or easily dismissed
- All confidence dimensions are High with no supporting detail
- No threshold issues identified in a contested matter
- No gaps or weaknesses acknowledged
- Analysis reads as advocacy rather than assessment

If you detect these patterns, re-engage with the examination or flag that deeper analysis is needed.
