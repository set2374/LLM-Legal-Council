# Legal Reasoning Foundation

## Purpose

Systematic legal thinking methodology.  This skill teaches HOW to analyze—not what the law is, but how to approach any legal question with rigor.

## The Lawyer's Mindset

**Think in probabilities, not absolutes:**
- Not "is this right?" but "how strong is this position?"
- Not "will we win?" but "what are the probabilities and what changes them?"
- Not "the law says" but "the better interpretation is, because..."

**Always consider alternatives:**
- If not A, then what?
- Even if A, what else?
- What if we're wrong about A?

**Every argument has counters:**
- What is the strongest counter?
- What is our response to that counter?
- What is their likely reply?

## Issue Identification

When confronting any legal situation, systematically identify:

**Legal issues:**
- What legal questions must be resolved?
- Which legal theories might apply?
- What elements must be proven or disproven?
- Which defenses might be available?

**Factual issues:**
- What facts are disputed?
- What facts are missing?
- Which facts are critical to the legal question?

**Threshold issues:**
- Jurisdiction (does this court have authority?)
- Standing (does this party have the right to sue?)
- Timeliness (is the claim within limitations?)
- Prerequisites (notice, demand, exhaustion?)
- Preclusion (does a prior judgment bar this?)

**Triage:** Not all issues deserve equal attention.  Critical issues (threshold, dispositive elements, limitations) come first.  Secondary issues (alternative theories, belt-and-suspenders arguments) come after.

## Analytical Frameworks

### IRAC (Default for Single Issues)

- **Issue**: What question must be answered?
- **Rule**: What legal standard applies?
- **Application**: How do facts meet or fail the standard?
- **Conclusion**: What result follows?

### CREAC (When Conclusion is Clear)

- **Conclusion**: State the answer upfront
- **Rule**: Legal standard supporting conclusion
- **Explanation**: How rule works, how it has been applied
- **Application**: Facts to rule
- **Conclusion**: Reaffirm

### Multi-Factor Balancing (When No Bright-Line Rule)

- List all relevant factors
- Assess each factor's weight
- Evaluate which way each cuts
- Weigh totality
- Reach balanced conclusion

### Analogical Reasoning (When Precedent Matters)

- Identify most similar cases
- Map factual similarities and differences
- Identify legal similarities and differences
- Argue why similarities or differences control

## Argument Construction

### Syllogistic Structure

Every legal argument reduces to syllogisms:

**Major Premise (Legal Rule):** What the law requires, prohibits, or permits

**Minor Premise (Factual Application):** How the facts fit or don't fit the rule

**Conclusion:** Therefore, legal consequence follows or doesn't

**Validation:** Is the major premise accurately stated?  Is the minor premise provable?  Does the conclusion necessarily follow?

### Multi-Path Arguments

Never rely on a single chain of reasoning:

**Primary path (strongest):** Most direct route, fewest inferential leaps, strongest authority

**Alternative path (backup):** Different theory, independent basis for same result

**Defensive path (fallback):** Even if we lose on offense, minimize damage

### The "Why" Protocol

Keep asking "why" until you reach bedrock:
- Position: "Defendant breached contract"
- Why? "Failed to deliver goods"
- Why is that breach? "Contract required delivery by date certain"
- Why does timing matter? "Time was of the essence"
- Why do we know this? "Express contract term"
- Bedrock: Documentary evidence exists

## Burden Analysis

Always know who must prove what:

**Plaintiff's burden:**
- Elements they must establish
- Standard of proof required
- Evidence needed

**Defendant's burden:**
- Affirmative defenses to prove
- Standard for defenses

**Burden-shifting:**
- What shifts burden?
- To whom does it shift?
- What must then be shown?

## Reasoning Validity

### Test for Logical Fallacies

- Affirming the consequent
- False dichotomy (ignoring alternatives)
- Circular reasoning (assuming conclusion)
- Non sequitur (conclusion doesn't follow)

### Test for Cognitive Biases

- Confirmation bias (seeing only supporting evidence)
- Anchoring (over-relying on first information)
- Availability (overweighting recent or memorable)

### Test for Legal Reasoning Errors

- Conflating holdings with dicta
- Overgeneralizing from limited cases
- Ignoring procedural posture
- Misallocating burdens

## Quality Check

Before finalizing analysis:

- Have all issues been identified and prioritized?
- Is there a clear analytical framework for each issue?
- Are arguments built on sound syllogisms?
- Have alternative paths been developed?
- Have assumptions been made explicit?
- Have burdens been properly allocated?
- Has opposing counsel's best argument been articulated?
